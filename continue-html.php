<h1>Continuing with HTML</h1>
<p>You just finished learning the basics of HTML and are feeling pretty good about yourself. You've made a basic site and learned basic HTML formatting and structuring. However, there's still stuff that we didn't cover. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Iframes</li>
<li>Charset</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>And a really long list of other cool things</li>
</ul>
<p>There are currently tons of great resources out there, and below is a list of some of my favorite resources:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each one of those has different purposes. I use w3schools as a reference for what's available. I also used their tutorials to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Udacity is great for learning some of the basic principles of web design, and learning how to make quality web sites. Stackoverflow is great for getting answers to questions, but it's also good for helping others with questions as well.
<p>I also use tools that let me test my code inside a web browser, since it helps me make changes quickly. This site does provide a <a href="try-html.php">live testing tool</a> that does precisley that, and there are other tools available as well.
