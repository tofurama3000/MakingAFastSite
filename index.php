<h1>Zombies come, high speed goes</h1>
<p>We all love watching/shooting slow zombies in video games that give you tons of time to do whatever you want before they even get within biting range of you. A ton of zombies are slow (some are not, but we won't worry about those). However, a zombie apocalypse bring more than slow-moving minins. Zombies tend to slow <b>everything</b> down!
<p>Just think about it: How many zombie apocalypses occur in the middle of no-where where nothing important is located? None. In how many apocalypses are important communication means left functioning? Pretty much zero. If there was no threat to anything important, no one would care, and it wouldn't be an apocalypse. If we still had communication, we'd be able to organize against the zombies before it became an apocalypse. Currently, the Internet is the important communication, so a zombie apocalypse will probably target our internet connection.
<h2>But the Internet? Wasn't that made to be indestructible?</h2>
Not quite. It was made to allow large portions of it to go offline, and not have the rest of it to go down too. It'll affect the speed of the rest of the world, since computers will use longer and more crowded connections to communicate, but they can still talk. In other words, the whole eastern seaboard of the U.S. can lose internet, but that shouldn't stop Greenland from getting online (however it <i>may</i> slow them down).
<h2>How slow is slow?</h2>
<p>Suppose we are unfortunate and lose all high speed internet. 2G isn't that bad. But, what if the only infrastructure left for us to use is Dial-Up? (When Egypt shut down its internet n 2011, <a href=http://www.dw.com/en/european-activists-offer-dial-up-internet-to-get-egypt-back-online/a-14807049">dial-up was the only way to connect</a>.)
<p>Let's say we had normal dial-up connection. That's 40-50kbs per second (kbs means thousands of bits per second). Compare that to 2G which ranges from 250-450kbs. The slow 2G connections are 5-9 times faster than dial-up! 
<p>This can work for non-time critical things, such as organizing an attack against zombies a week in advanced. But it's not going to help you to know if a buddy is in a house that's surrounded by twelve different zombies and needs you to hop in your truck and drive over there in a mission-impossible way to save him from impending doom. That is unless we use a web site designed for dial-up.
<p>That's the purpose of this site, to help you create awesome websites that will work and load fast using dial-up (like, let's say 1-2 seconds). This site will teach you how to create a website that runs fast, looks good, and works on any device so that you can have an awesome zombie-fighting crew that is able to be organized, even if you're running on dial-up speeds.
<p>The purpose of this site is not to give a full overview of how all web elements work, although there is an <a href="into-html.php">HTML Primer</a>. It's purpose is to take basic web development knowledge and add the understanding of what your decisions make with regard to loading times.
<p>So, let's get started with the <a href="building-blocks.php">Building Blocks</a> for any website.
