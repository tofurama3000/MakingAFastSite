<h1>Don't Limit Yourself</h1>
<p>With all of these optimizations and techniques, its really easy to get caught up scrutinizing every last bit or tyring to get as many frames per second in an animation. Worse yet, we can start putting harmful limits or bounds on us to prevent us from making a site that reaches it's full potential. Don't. Yes we need fast sites, yes we need to be mindful of the Critical Rendering path, but we also need to remember that making a web page is as much an art as it is a science.
<p>How we choose to format content, what content we put on, which libraries we use, it's all an art and it allows us to express ourselves. When we use jQuery over Angular or React, it's our own way of expressing ourselves, whether it be it's our preferred library, or it's "smaller" or "faster", all of those are statements about what we want the experience of the site to be and how we want to express ourselves. Remember, the main reason for a fast site is to allow more people to experience our self-expression how we want them to experience it.
<h1>Fast Development</h1>
<p>I'm probably going to get scolded for saying this, but there are plenty of times when fast development is more important than a fast web page. Now, what do I mean? Personally, I'd rather have a short time developing personal websites than having a fast one. I'm not getting paid for doing it and I still want to do other things on my weekends.
<p>With professional sites I've worked on, oftentimes payment is based on how fast a site or product hits the market (even if you're paid hourly, that paycheck is dependent upon the saleability of a product, and it has to be "done" before it can be sold). What this means, is if it's a decision between spending 3 months writing an awful, broken mess of code to add a complex feature, or 3 days to add in a new library that's well tested and supported to add in that same feature, I'll go with adding in the library. It can make things a slower than a bare-bones made-for-just-that-feature solution, but overall it'll work out since I can then go in and do asynchronous loading and file minification and concatenation on the server side to minimize that loading time, and it'll be easier to maintain.
<p>Remember, a big part of this is prioritizing, and your own time and sanity are invaluable assets that need to be prioritized.
<h1>Have Fun</h1>
<p>Need I say more?
<p>I personally enjoy website building, I enjoy challenges, and I have fun when doing them. Remember that at the end of the day, having fun while working is also important.
